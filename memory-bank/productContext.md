# Product Context

## Purpose
This template serves as a foundation for building modern web applications using Next.js 15. It addresses common challenges in setting up a production-ready Next.js project by providing a standardized, well-structured starting point.

## Problems Solved
1. **Project Structure Complexity**
   - Implements recommended App Router directory structure
   - Clear separation of components, utilities, and API routes
   - Organized routing with proper loading and error states

2. **TypeScript Integration**
   - Full TypeScript setup with proper configurations
   - Type safety across the entire application
   - Integrated development tools and linting

3. **UI Component Standardization**
   - Integration of Shadcn UI components
   - Consistent design patterns
   - Accessibility built-in

4. **API Documentation**
   - Automated Swagger documentation
   - Structured API route organization
   - Built-in documentation viewer

## How It Works
1. **Project Organization**
   - `app/` contains route-specific components and pages
   - `components/` houses shared UI components
   - `lib/` stores utilities and helpers
   - `public/` manages static assets
   - `memory-bank/` maintains project documentation

2. **Development Workflow**
   - Uses pnpm for package management
   - Implements Git best practices with conventional commits
   - Follows branch-based development workflow

3. **API Development**
   - Structured API routes with documentation
   - Automated Swagger generation
   - Built-in testing capabilities

## User Experience Goals
1. **Developer Experience**
   - Clear project structure
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Type safety and autocompletion
   - Integrated development tools

2. **Performance**
   - Server Components by default
   - Optimized build process
   - Efficient data fetching
   - Smart component loading

3. **Maintainability**
   - Consistent coding patterns
   - Documentation-driven development
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Type safety throughout
